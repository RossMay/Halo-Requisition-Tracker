# Halo Requisition Tracker
Adds a button to the Halo Waypoint requisition pages into the URL bar which when pressed load each of the req pages and parses out a list of IDs and names of each item you have unlocked. This list is then meant to be inserted into a modified version of this spreadsheet. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pYEm151mtG6ylJr2uTCIGhKh2S8fwSQxwhreYsG0TWY/edit#gid=1184985090

It will then automatically update to show your progress on all items.
